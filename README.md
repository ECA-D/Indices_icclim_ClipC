Routine to calculate icclim [CLIPC] indices using the icclim python module.

Upgrade to python codes:

- works with both bias corrected and non-bias corrected data
- up to date with DRS ClipC framework from May 2016 (might need change as updates appear)

To be used further with SMHI model data output.
